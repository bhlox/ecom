# Minimal E-commerce Setup

A backend REST api implementation for an e-commerce platform, written in GoLang. It provides essential functionalities for user sign-ups, authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), checkout processes, and retrieving orders. This project is more of a personal experience to understand core concepts of Go, particularly setting up an HTTP application.

## Tools Used

This project utilizes several tools to streamline development and testing processes. Here's a brief overview of some of the key tools used:

- [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) - development live reload
- [sqlc](https://sqlc.io/) - somewhat sql query generator / ORM
- [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) - manage db schemas
- [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/)

## Testcontainers

Testcontainers is integrated to set up and tear down database containers for our integration tests. This ensures that each test runs in a clean environment, preventing state leakage between tests and making our tests more reliable and easier to debug.

Currently a bug is still present when executing the test command for this project.
If you are encountering this along the test. Just keep testing till it passses (I know it's stupid).
